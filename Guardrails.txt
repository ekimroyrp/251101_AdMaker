Don't pull from github unless I tell you to.
Always push and pull with git from my account ekimroyrp with the email ekimroyrp@gmail.com.
On the first git push make sure the default main branch is named main, do not change its name to anything else.
Give each git commited file or folder a unique description based on what the commit was about.
Create an initial README.md which give a paragraph summary of the project as a whole as well as a features list, getting started, and controls at the first push commit to github.
Update the README.md before each push commit to github to include any major new features, getting started, or controls, don't update the README.md with minor changes.
Don't keep track of git commits after each instruction or git diff cacheing, only check changes when merging and pushing to github. 
Don't compact the context unless I tell you to.
